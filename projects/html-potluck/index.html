            <b>SYNOPSIS</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Way of Water is set 15 years after the events 
            of the first film. Due to a one year time 
            skip during the story, most of the film's 
            events are set in 2170. Similar to the first 
            film, the story is set across months with only 
            the more important scenes being shown.
            The Way of Water follows the journey of Jake Sully 
            and Neytiri's newfound family of children. 
            Despite their best efforts to keep their family 
            together, a familiar threat resurfaces because 
            Earth is dying, and forces the Sully family to 
            become refugees and flee to the land of the 
            Metkayina clan in the Pandoran oceans.

            the daughter of the governor and the love of 
            Will's life, has been kidnapped by the

            He, along with his large crew, are under an 
            ancient curse, doomed for eternity to neither
