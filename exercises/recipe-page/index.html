        <h2>THE SAUCE AND COLESLAW</h2>
        <p>
            We are going to work backward with this recipe! 
            Although the chicken is obviously the star of 
            the recipe, making the sauce and coleslaw comes 
            first so the chicken can be enjoyed straight 
            from the fryer. Since fried chicken can be a bit 
            heavier and in this case with Nasvhille-style, 
            very spiced, it's important to add some refreshing 
            more tangy elements. The coleslaw adds a nice 
            crunch and refreshing taste while the sauce adds a 
            creamy texture but is also a bit tangy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's start with the sauce! In a bowl, mix 
            together mayonnaise, ketchup, garlic powder, 
            Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper until well 
            combined. The color will be a light pink/orange 
            color. Raising Cane's sauce is my favorite to enjoy 
            with fried chicken so this recipe is meant to be a 
            copycat. Cover and set aside until we need it!
        </p>
        <p>
            As for the coleslaw, combine shredded cabbage 
            and carrots in a bowl, then dress it with a 
            mixture of mayonnaise, yellow mustard, apple 
            cider vinegar or lemon juice, sugar, salt, and 
            black pepper. Let the coleslaw chill in the 
            refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before 
            serving, allowing the flavors to develop. You 
            can buy a coleslaw blend from the grocery store 
            or just purchase cabbage and carrot and shred it
            yourself. Now that those components are prepared, 
            we can move on to the chicken!

        <h2>THE CHICKEN</h2>
        <p>
            The journey to crafting the perfect Nashville hot 
            chicken sandwich begins with the chicken itself. 
            Start by marinating boneless, skinless chicken 
            breasts or thighs in buttermilk for at least an 
            hour, or preferably overnight, in the refrigerator. 
            This step not only tenderizes the chicken but also 
            infuses it with flavor. For the crispy coating, 
            create a seasoned flour mixture by combining all-purpose 
            flour with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion 
            powder, cayenne pepper, and paprika. For an extra 
            crunch, consider adding a touch of cornstarch or 
            panko breadcrumbs to the mix. Dredge the marinated 
            chicken in the seasoned flour until fully coated, 
            then fry it in hot oil until golden brown and crispy 
            on the outside, yet juicy on the inside.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, let's turn up the heat. Nashville hot chicken 
            wouldn't be complete without its signature spicy 
            seasoning. In a bowl, mix together cayenne pepper, 
            paprika, brown sugar, salt, black pepper, garlic 
            powder, and onion powder. To create a paste, add 
            vegetable oil or melted butter to the spice mixture. 
            For those who crave even more spice, a splash of hot 
            sauce can be added to the mix. Adjust the spice 
            level according to your preference, ensuring it 
            strikes the perfect balance of heat and flavor.
        </p>
        <h2>ASSEMBLY</h2>
        <p>
            Now that all the components are ready, it's 
            time to assemble the sandwich. Toast soft buns 
            until golden brown and warm. Spread a thin 
            layer of the spicy sauce on the bottom bun, then 
            top it with a piece of crispy fried chicken. 
            Add a few slices of tangy pickles and a generous 
            spoonful of coleslaw. Finally, crown the sandwich 
            with the top bun and press down gently to secure all the layers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Serve your Nashville hot chicken sandwich 
            alongside your favorite sides, such as crispy 
            fries, creamy coleslaw, or a refreshing cucumber 
            salad. Pair it with a cold beer or a tall glass 
            of sweet tea to help cool down the heat. With 
            its perfect combination of crispy, spicy chicken 
            and tangy toppings, this iconic Southern dish is 
            sure to become a favorite in your kitchen.
