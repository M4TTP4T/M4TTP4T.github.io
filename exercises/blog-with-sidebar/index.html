                    Final Fantasy XVI is set in the fictional 
                    world of Valisthea. Scattered throughout 
                    the two continents of Ash and Storm are 
                    colossal magical crystals, known as the 
                    Mothercrystals, which provide aether energy 
                    to the various populations and drive 
                    civilization with shards mined for 
                    commercial use. There are also humans 
                    that can use magic without crystals known 
                    as Bearers who are subject to prejudice and 
                    slavery, their overuse causing them to 
                    gradually petrify. A powerful force 
                    in Valisthea are the Eikons, magical creatures 
                    of incredible power that are utilized by 
                    hosts called Dominants. There are eight Eikons, 
                    one for each of the elements - Phoenix (fire), 
                    Shiva (ice), Ramuh (thunder), Leviathan (water), 
                    Titan (earth), Garuda (wind), Odin (darkness), 
                    and Bahamut (light); a seemingly impossible 
                    second Eikon of fire, Ifrit, drives the 
                    main plot by disrupting this balance.

                    The core nations of Valisthea are the 
                    Grand Duchy of Rosaria, the Holy Empire 
                    of Sanbreque, and the Dhalmekian 
                    Republic on the Storm continent, the 
                    Kingdom of Waloed which dominates the Ash 
                    continent, and the neutral Crystalline 
                    Dominion sitting between Ash and Storm. 
                    An outlier is the Iron Kingdom, an 
                    isolated nation off the coast of Storm 
                    overseen by the Crystalline Orthodox. 
                    In the backstory an ancient people, humanity's 
                    ancestors the Fallen, once dominated Valisthea 
                    before a cataclysm destroyed their 
                    civilization, leaving ruins across the 
                    land. By the game's events, Valisthea 
                    is suffering from a depletion of aether 
                    dubbed the Blight which withers all life, 
                    driving the nations into conflict with 
                    each other. Because of their ability to 
                    manifest Eikons, Dominants play a key 
                    role in the nations' politics and military. 
                    Depending on where they are born, Dominants 
                    are hailed as political leaders, tolerated 
                    due to their power, or suffer abuse and are 
                    either killed or used as weapons of war.

                    is his childhood friend Jill Warrick, the

                    The game was praised by critics for its 
                    story, graphics, music, and gameplay. 
                    Criticism focused on lack of role-playing 
                    elements, technical issues, and side quest 
                    design. The game sold over three million units 
                    during its first week after launch, but failed 
                    to meet Square Enix's expectations. After release, 
                    the game was supported by a variety of downloadable 
                    content, including story-focused campaigns and 
                    smaller patches to include new features and in-game 
                    items.
