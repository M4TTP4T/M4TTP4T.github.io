            <p>
               SCUF Envision was designed to deliver the best 
               experience for controller PC gamers. Equipped with 11
               additional remappable inputs, ultra-fast wired/wireless 
               connectivity, and advanced software for macros
               and endless customization options. More control, 
               more finesse, and more performance than your
               typical console contoller.
